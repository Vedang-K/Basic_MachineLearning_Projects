# 🍊 Orange vs Grapefruit Classification (Basic Machine Learning Project)

This repository contains a **beginner-level machine learning project** that performs **binary classification between Oranges and Grapefruits** using basic supervised learning techniques.

The goal of this project is **learning and practice**, not innovation — it focuses on understanding the **end-to-end ML workflow**: data handling, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Build a simple binary classifier to distinguish between **oranges** and **grapefruits**
- Understand how feature-based classification works
- Practice basic ML concepts such as:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Train-test splitting
  - Model training
  - Performance evaluation

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Preprocess features (scaling/formatting)  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train a classification model  
5. Evaluate model performance  
6. Make predictions on unseen data
